          <p>Design is the process of envisioning and planning the creation of objects, to creating solutions for people, physical items or more abstract systems to address a need or a problem.</p>
          <p>Design has very broad concepts and varieties from one field to another in many aspects of our lives from product design, sound, virtual reality, interaction, to design cars, video games, software interfaces, interiors, etc.</p>

        <h1>A common misconception about design</h1>
        <h3>Design is not about making things pretty just for the sake of it</h3>
        <p>Nowadays, it can be categorized as a fancy sounding word, and there seems to be a certain amount of misconceptions surrounding it.</br>But what is it really at its core? Is it simply a process to make pretty looking things? Far from it. It doesn’t focus purely on aesthetics, nor is it about adding ornaments to an item. First and foremost is it about making the user’s interaction with the environment more natural and complete.</p>

        <h1>The key concepts of design</h1>
        <h3>1. Art or science?</h3>
		    <p>While not being exactly an art nor a science, it takes elements from both. Art is about creating something that expresses the author’s vision, ideas and feelings. While designers can express feelings and leave impressions through their work, doing so is not their prime objective.</br> So it takes the creating aspect of art, as it is about crafting an item, a tool, an experience even.</p>

          <h3>2. The creative design process</h3>
          <p>Problems are best solved when approached in a comprehensive and systemic way. The goal of this process is to guide you and organize your work to turn ideas into concrete solutions. Designers do research and collect information about the problem they are considering: who is person facing this problem? Why? How are other people trying to solve it?<br> From this research, they make a general hypothesis and identify the main features should be part of the answer. Then with these key aspects in mind it’s time to experiment different solutions and iterate. This last part is about learning from what works, what doesn’t to adapt your solution to fit the user’s need best.</p>

        <h3>3. Great design is invisible</h3>
        <p>It is achieved when the user doesn’t even notice its presence. This principle is particularly true in interaction design. Navigating a user interface should feel natural and unhindered.</br>The user should be able to understand its rules and the meaning of its elements almost immediately. The user is guided by an invisible hand made of colors, shapes, contrast, repetitions.</p>
